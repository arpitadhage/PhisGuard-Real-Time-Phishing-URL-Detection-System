🔐 PhisGuard – Real-Time Phishing URL Detection System
# 🔐 PhisGuard – Phishing Website Detection Using Hybrid ML  and Rule-Based URL Intelligence

PhisGuard is an end-to-end phishing URL detection platform that combines Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and a Chrome Extension to provide real-time website security analysis.

The system integrates a FastAPI backend with an ensemble ML pipeline (XGBoost + Keras MLP) trained on the PhiUSIIL Phishing URL Dataset (UCI ID 967) to classify URLs as **Phishing** or **Legitimate** in real time.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Phishing attacks remain one of the most common cybersecurity threats. Traditional blacklist-based detection fails to detect newly generated malicious URLs.

PhisGuard addresses this by:
- Extracting lexical features from URLs
- Using an ensemble learning approach
- Providing instant classification via a browser extension

## 🧠 Machine Learning Architecture

### Dataset
- PhiUSIIL Phishing URL Dataset
- UCI Machine Learning Repository (ID 967)

### Feature Engineering
- Lexical URL-based features
- Length-based metrics
- Special character counts
- Domain-based indicators

### Models Used
- **XGBoost Classifier** (Gradient Boosting)
- **Keras Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

### Ensemble Strategy
Final prediction is generated by combining probability outputs from both models for improved robustness and accuracy.
